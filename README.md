# EPOS4-CANBUS

Here is a comprehensive code that incorporates all the necessary steps to control the EPOS4 motor using the Arduino with the MCP2515 CAN module. This code will:

1. Check the drive state using the Statusword.
2. Transition the drive state through the necessary Controlwords.
3. Set the Mode of Operation to Profile Velocity Mode (PVM).
4. Send speed commands to the motor.
5. Reset faults if they occur and provide feedback.

Explanation of the Code:

1. Initialization:

- Sets up the MCP2515 CAN module and initializes communication at 125 kbps.
- Sets the Mode of Operation to Profile Velocity Mode (PVM) and transitions the drive to the "Operation Enabled" state using the enableOperation() function.

2. Main Loop:

- Reads user input from the Serial Monitor for:
  -Sending Controlwords in hexadecimal format.
  -Sending speed values in hexadecimal format using the speed <value> command.
  -Reading the Statusword using the readstatus command.

3. Functions:

- setModeOfOperation(): Sets the Mode of Operation to Profile Velocity Mode.
- sendControlWord(): Sends a Controlword to the EPOS4 to control the motor state.
- setTargetVelocity(): Sends the desired speed to the Target Velocity object.
- enableOperation(): Transitions the motor state from "Switch On Disabled" to "Operation Enabled".
- requestStatusWord(): Requests the current Statusword from the EPOS4 to check the state.
- interpretStatusWord(): Interprets and prints the drive state based on the Statusword value.

How to Use:

1. Upload the Code: Load the code onto your Arduino Mega.
2. Open the Serial Monitor: Set the baud rate to 115200.
3. Enter Controlwords:

   - Use 0x0006 for "Ready to Switch On".
   - Use 0x0007 for "Switched On".
   - Use 0x000F for "Operation Enabled".
   - Use speed <hex_value> to set the motor speed (e.g., speed 0x000003E8 for 1000 counts/sec).

4. Check Status: Use readstatus to read the current state of the drive.

Troubleshooting:

- Drive State: Use readstatus frequently to ensure the drive is in the "Operation Enabled" state.
- Faults: If the Statusword indicates a fault, reset using 0x0080 (Fault Reset).
- Power Supply: Ensure the motor and EPOS4 have adequate power.
